Project to configure and read a 3 dof magnetometer with I2C and then echo everything on the UART, in my setup I use a UART to USB chip by FDTI and I read everything using a Qt GUI able to plot in real time the stream of data.
=======
Simple interface with the 3 dof Magnetometer Triaxis by Melexis: <br>
<br>
1- Firmware for LPC11C24: <br>
 a- I2C init <br>
 b- Setup sensor through I2C <br>
 c- Reading of data <br>
 d- Echo of the data to a UARTtoUSB FDTI chip <br>
      <br>
2- Qt GUI to read and plot the data in real time on a Windows machine <br>
